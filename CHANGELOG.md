### Migration Guide

If you're using the API from the developer preview:

   - New: Use your deployed production endpoint

2. **Trust scores:**
   - Trust scores no longer include "TEMP-" prefix
   - Scores now display as clean percentages (e.g., "95%")

3. **Agent IDs:**
   - Temporary agent IDs (TEMP-XXXXXXX) continue to work
   - Create an account to convert to permanent credentials

4. **No code changes required** - All endpoints remain backward compatible
